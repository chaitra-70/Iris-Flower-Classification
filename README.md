# Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning)
A moderate-level ML project using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify iris flowers into three species based on petal and sepal measurements.
## Steps Performed
- Loaded Iris dataset from sklearn
- Performed train-test split (80%–20%)
- Standardized features using StandardScaler
- Trained a KNN classifier with k=5
- Evaluated accuracy
- Plotted the confusion matrix
- Predicted sample iris flowers

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Skills Demonstrated
- Preprocessing & Standardization  
- KNN Algorithm  
- Model evaluation  
- Visualization
